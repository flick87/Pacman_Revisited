I created this project from scratch using various online resources for guidance. All the sprites are my glorious artwork, feel free to use. I've included a javadoc to go along with the code. 

Quick Note:
Game.java -> Game Driver

Character.java has the children Ghost and Pacman
Item.java has the children Niblet (pellet) and PowerPellet

Map.Java has a 2D array of Cells

Instructions:

Load the Java project into your favorite IDE and build/run.

Gameplay:
-Use the arrow keys to move around the map. 
-Press T to skip from level to level
